Start writing a simple game engine...  
Learning from the famous Hazel Engine  

Entry point: starting the application from the engine and defined by the client  

EventDispatcher: check if event type matches the statictype if yes then handle the event (which defined from the event func), it is getting called at Application::Onevent function

binding the event call back in the setup of window at the application construction (SetEventCallBack)

ImGui layer inhieritated from layer class.  
construction by Onattach function, which calles from push layer function  
Update function: get singleton app -> size update->delta time update -> newframe of imgui -> render()  

The OnEvent Function: through imgui layer on event function,　construct one dispatcher and bind all events function into the dispatcher,　it check the event type and　fall them into corresponding type function
